# Raise3 API Integration Summary

This document summarizes the API integration we've implemented for the Raise3 backend.

## API Integration Components

We've created the following components:

1. **Core API Infrastructure**:
   - API client with authentication and error handling
   - Configuration management for endpoints and environment settings
   - Comprehensive TypeScript types for all API entities

2. **Service Modules**:
   - Auth - Authentication services using wallet-based login
   - Users - User profile and KYC management
   - Campaigns - Campaign listing, creation, updating, and status management
   - Contracts - Smart contract integration services
   - Dashboard - Analytics and dashboard data services
   - Files - File upload and management
   - Investments - Investment recording and tracking

3. **React Query Hooks**:
   - Data fetching with caching, loading states, and error handling
   - Optimized state management with automatic refetching
   - Mutation functions for data updates

4. **Example Components**:
   - CampaignList - Displays and filters campaigns
   - InvestmentForm - Form for investing in campaigns
   - AuthContext - Context provider for authentication state

5. **Demo Page**:
   - Showcases the API integration
   - Provides examples of components using the API
   - Links to API documentation

## API Endpoints Integrated

We've integrated all the endpoints from the Raise3 backend API:

- Authentication endpoints (connect-wallet, verify-signature, etc.)
- User profile management endpoints
- Campaign management endpoints
- Smart contract interface endpoints
- Dashboard data endpoints
- File management endpoints
- Investment management endpoints

## Next Steps

To continue improving the integration:

1. Add more robust error handling and user feedback
2. Implement component-specific skeletons for loading states
3. Add offline capability and error recovery
4. Enhance typing for better development experience
5. Add comprehensive unit tests for API services and hooks
